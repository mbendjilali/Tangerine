# Debug Summary for Movie Picker Application

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Missing Functions in mediaData.js**:
   - Added `getMovies()` function that was being called from movieList.js
   - Added `sortMovies()` function for sorting movie lists
   - Added `filterMovies()` function for filtering movie lists

2. **Function Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - Fixed `addToWatchlist` vs `addToWatchList` mismatch (capitalization)
   - Updated imports and function calls in:
     - `src/components/search.js`
     - `src/components/movieDetails.js`
     - `src/components/suggestions.js`

3. **Import/Export Mismatches in suggestionService.js**:
   - Changed `getSuggestionMovies()` to `getCurrentSuggestions()`
   - Changed `updateSuggestions()` to `saveSuggestions()`
   - Implemented a replacement for `replaceInData()` using getCurrentSuggestions() and saveSuggestions()

4. **Circular Dependencies**:
   - Removed the direct import of `renderMovies` in app.js to avoid circular dependencies
   - Let initMovieList() handle calling renderMovies() internally

## Testing Approach

1. Created test.js and test.html to:
   - Capture and display JavaScript errors
   - Log detailed error information
   - Test the initialization process

2. Added more robust error handling to ensure graceful degradation

3. Created more descriptive error messages to help with debugging

## Remaining Items to Check

1. Verify that all event listeners are properly attached
2. Check that all API calls are properly handled
3. Ensure localStorage operations work correctly
4. Test movie search, add, and rating functionality
5. Verify that suggestions work as expected

## How to Use the Test Files

1. Open test.html in a browser
2. Check the console for any error messages
3. The page will indicate if initialization was successful
4. If errors occur, they will be displayed on the page with details
